Microcontroller-Based Data Logger (Personal Project)

Designed a 2-layer PCB using KiCad for a microcontroller-based data logging system.

Integrated components including ATmega328P, EEPROM (24LC1025), and RTC (DS1337S+).

Enabled SPI, I2C, and GPIO interfaces for expandability.

Designed and routed custom PCB traces, labeled components, and generated Gerber files for manufacturing.

Included features such as external communication headers, battery backup for RTC, and status LEDs.
